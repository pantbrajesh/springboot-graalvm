<h1>Comparing Startup time & Memory footprint for reactive application</h1>

The standard way takes about ```6.311``` seconds to start up and it uses around ```767``` MB of RAM:

Now comparing our Natively compiled Spring Boot App, we see a startup time of about ```1.295``` seconds:

and uses only ```165MB``` of RAM:

So with a default Spring App we have around ```800MB``` memory consumption, a natively compiled Spring App has only ```165MB``` . 
That means, we could run more than ```4``` Spring microservices with the same amount of RAM we needed for only one standard Spring microservice.
